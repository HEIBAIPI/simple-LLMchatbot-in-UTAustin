# LLM Chatbot - Technical Overview

## How the Chatbot Works

This chatbot is built using the **Groq API** with the `gemma2-9b-it` model. Here's how it operates:

### Core Architecture
- **API Integration**: Uses Groq's API for fast LLM inference
- **Streaming Responses**: Implements real-time streaming to display responses as they're generated, providing a more natural conversation flow
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains conversation history using a message array system that tracks both user and assistant messages
- **Memory Management**: Automatically prunes conversation history when it exceeds 3 message pairs to prevent context overflow

### Technical Features
- **Real-time Display**: Processes streaming chunks and displays them immediately with proper formatting
- **Newline Compression**: Cleans up multiple consecutive newlines for better readability
- **Error Handling**: Checks for null content in streaming responses

The chatbot features three distinct personalities that users can choose from:

### 1. FriendlyBot (Personality 1)
